\section{Overarching Goal}
% Briefly state the main goal of the lab
The human eye can be described as a complex optical instrument that focuses
light rays using a muscular tissue (the eye lens) and a light-sensitive layer
that converts the focused light into electrical signals transmitted to the
brain.  The focus of this lab report is to utilize the knowledge of our previous
labs on geometriclens modeling to apply it at a fundamental level to generalize
the behaviour of the human eye and study is relation to common eye disseases.

\section{Theory}
% Explain the physics concepts behind the lab. Include relevant equations if needed.
As light travels through space, its interaction with matter affects the speed at
which the electromagnetic waves that carry it move through a medium. These
interactions produce refraction, a phenomenon that can be described at the
macroscopic scale by Snell’s law, $n_1sin(\theta_1)=n_2sin(\theta_2)$, where $n_1$
and $n_2$ are the indices of refraction of the two media, and $\theta_1$ and $\theta_2$
are the angles measured with respect to the normal to the surface. Rather than
tracking individual light–matter interactions, this description allows the
overall bending of light to be predicted using simple geometric relationships.

In the geometrical optics approximation, the propagation of light through
refracting surfaces is modeled using rays, which trace the direction of light
and provide an intuitive picture of how images are formed. This ray-based model
makes it possible to describe complex optical systems using a small set of
distances and angles. When applied to ideal lenses and restricted to small
angles relative to the optical axis, these relationships reduce to the thin-lens
equation:

$$ \frac{1}{f} = \frac{1}{d_o} + \frac{1}{d_i}  $$ where:
\begin{itemize}
  \item $f$ is the focal length (in $m$)
  \item $d_o$ is the object distance (in $m$)
  \item $d_i$ is the image distance (in $m$)
\end{itemize}

This equation provides a direct way to predict where an image will form once
the focal length of the lens is known.

The focal length itself depends on the physical properties of the lens. This
dependence is described by the lens maker’s equation,

$$ \frac{1}{f} = (n - 1) \left( \frac{1}{R_1} - \frac{1}{R_2} \right) $$ where:
\begin{itemize}
  \item $n$ is the index of refraction of the lens material and
  \item $R_1$ and $R_2$ are the radii of curvature of the lens surfaces.
\end{itemize}



Although highly simplified, together these model captures the essential behavior of many
real optical systems. In particular, it provides a useful framework for
understanding the human eye as an imaging system, where changes in lens shape
and focal length determine how light is brought into focus on the retina. In the
case of the human eye, the lens is flexible, and surrounding muscles can change
its curvature. By altering the radii of curvature, the eye effectively changes
its focal length, allowing objects at different distances to be brought into
focus on the retina.

\section{Apparatus}

\subsection{Homemade Eye Model}
Our setup for this section consisted of a ``screen'' (a plane where the light
was focused), a convex lens placed $20\,\text{cm}$ from the screen, and an
object placed $22.5\,\text{cm}$ from the convex lens. All measurements were
conducted in a dark environment to allow for greater precision.

\subsection{Variable Lens Model}

\subsubsection*{Fixed Lens Test}
Before beginning the experiment, we tested the PASCO eye model by placing a
$400\,\text{mm}$ focal length lens in the SEPTUM slot and positioning an object
$50\,\text{cm}$ from the lens.

\subsubsection*{Variable Lens}
Afterwards, the variable lens was filled with water until its membrane was flat.
The connecting tube was then attached to a syringe, which was filled
approximately three-quarters full. The tube was reconnected to the variable
lens, replacing the previous $400\,\text{mm}$ lens in the setup.


\section{Purpose of Each Activity}

\subsection*{Activity 1.}
To construct a simplified physical model of the human eye and establish its
correspondence with the geometrical optics framework introduced in the theory
section, identifying how the retina, lens, and optical axis are represented
within the thin-lens approximation.

\subsection*{Activity 2.}
To incorporate a variable-focus lens into the eye model in order to simulate
the eye’s ability to accommodate, directly applying the thin-lens equation to
demonstrate how changes in focal length affect image formation on the retina.

\subsection*{Activity 3.}
To quantitatively determine the magnitude of the focal length adjustment
required for proper retinal imaging, using the thin-lens equation to relate
object distance, image distance, and lens focal length in the context of the
human eye.

\subsection*{Activity 4.}
To analyze common eye diseases by interpreting them as deviations from the
idealized optical model, using the thin-lens and lens maker’s equations to
understand how changes in curvature or effective focal length lead to impaired
vision.

\section{Method}
% Step-by-step procedure

\subsection{Activity 1: Construction of a Simple Eye Model}

\begin{itemize}
  \item A converging (biconvex) lens was mounted along an optical axis to represent the crystalline lens of the human eye.
  \item A translucent screen was placed at a fixed distance behind the lens to model the retina.
  \item An illuminated object was positioned in front of the lens at varying distances to serve as the object being imaged by the eye.
  \item The relative positions of the object, lens, and screen were adjusted until a clear image was formed on the screen.
  \item The orientation and nature (real or virtual) of the image formed on the screen were observed and recorded.
  \item The object distance was varied while maintaining the screen position fixed, and changes in image sharpness were qualitatively analyzed.
  \item Observations were interpreted using the thin-lens equation to determine which optical parameters must change in a real eye to maintain focus.
\end{itemize}

\subsection{Activity 2: Simulation of Eye Accommodation}

\begin{itemize}
  \item A PASCO eye model was assembled with the retina placed in the slot labeled \textit{NORMAL}.
  \item A fixed converging lens was initially inserted to represent the combined effect of the cornea and eye lens.
  \item An illuminated cell phone screen was positioned approximately $50\,\text{cm}$ from the cornea, and its position was adjusted until a focused image was obtained on the retina.
  \item The object was translated laterally and longitudinally to observe changes in image position and focus.
  \item The fixed lens was removed and replaced with an adjustable-focus lens filled with water.
  \item Air bubbles were removed from the adjustable lens to ensure uniform refraction.
  \item The object distance was set to approximately $25\,\text{cm}$, and the lens curvature was adjusted using the syringe until a sharp retinal image was obtained.
  \item The procedure was repeated for an object distance of approximately $50\,\text{cm}$.
  \item Changes in lens power required for near and far vision were recorded and analyzed.
\end{itemize}

\subsection{Activity 3: Quantitative Analysis of Eye Accommodation}

\begin{itemize}
  \item Relevant anatomical and optical parameters of the human eye obtained from preliminary work were identified.
  \item The lens maker’s equation was used to model the dependence of focal length on the radii of curvature of the eye lens.
  \item The posterior radius of curvature was held constant while the anterior radius was varied over a defined range.
  \item For each radius configuration, the corresponding focal length was calculated.
  \item The results were tabulated to examine how small changes in curvature affect the focal length.
  \item Trends in the data were analyzed to distinguish between fine and coarse tuning mechanisms in eye accommodation.
\end{itemize}

\subsection{Activity 4: Modeling Common Eye Diseases}

\begin{itemize}
  \item The PASCO eye model was configured to simulate normal vision using an appropriate converging lens and retina position.
  \item To model hyperopia, the retina was moved forward to shorten the effective eye length, and the resulting image blur was observed.
  \item A pupil aperture was inserted to study the effect of pupil size on image clarity.
  \item Corrective lenses of varying power were introduced to restore focus, and the optimal lens power was determined.
  \item To model myopia, the retina was moved backward to lengthen the effective eye length.
  \item The image formation for distant objects was analyzed under this configuration.
  \item Diverging or weakly converging corrective lenses were tested to compensate for the altered focal conditions.
  \item Observations were interpreted using the thin-lens and lens maker’s equations to relate anatomical changes to optical defects.
\end{itemize}
